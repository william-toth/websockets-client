# React Notes - with websockets

The readme for the original react notes project can be found here: https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-21S/react-notes-william-toth

Backend repo: https://github.com/william-toth/websocket-backend

Deployed app: https://notes-with-sockets.netlify.app/

Note: optimization for dragging didn't work very well due the structure of my original project (update sends all fields), so still looks slightly janky on the deployed app
